### Hi there 👋

I'm currently leading Applied AI at Google DeepMind in Singapore.
Previously I was a Software Engineer at Meta (Singapore) and Google (NYC and then Singapore).
I've worked in Python, Dart, Javascript, Node.js, TypeScript, and some Java.
I'm curious to learn more about Rust and keep exploring interesting AI-powered development and design tools.

- 🔭 I'm currently exploring interesting applications of AI in the real world, to showcase what DeepMind models can do and find things they struggle with.
- 🔭 At Meta, I worked on WhatsApp, then Ad Signal, then as a technical advisor to the COO.
- 🔭 At Google, I worked on [Mojaloop][], [Payments][Payments], and [API design][aip].
